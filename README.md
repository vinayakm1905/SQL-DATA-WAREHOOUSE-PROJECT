Building Modern Datawarehouse using SQL Server including ETL, Data modeling and Analysis
project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:


Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
